 				A good thief always studies his target before going in for the grab. Thief Simulator allows players to do just that, with different ways of gathering information on the houses in each neighborhood.In order to learn the most ideal time to enter a house, the thief will need to study the tenant’s daily routines. The main way of doing this is locating one member of the household and marking them with the interaction button.This adds an outline to all tenants, and reveals 6 hours of their daily routine, which is displayed in the upper right hand corner of the UI.The outline lets the thief know where the tenants are on the property, but it is only visible during the known segment(s) of their routine. To get the full routine, the player will have to repeat this action three more times, once during each 6-hour segment of a 24-hour period.

				Each house has some level of security to it. Whether or not that security provides a challenge depends on the tools the thief brings with him.All houses have their windows locked, and the noisiest solution to that is the crowbar. As long as no one is home, breaking a window will not alert the police; however, if at least one tenant is on the property, an alarm will sound and the police will be called.A subtler option is using the glass knife to cut a simple hole in the window. Regardless of the thief’s position when the knife is used, the hole will always appear in the center of a nine-pane window, and the top of a two-pane window.In Richie R Street and the Industrial Area, several homes and buildings have a glass cutter detector that will trigger an alarm as soon as the glass knife makes a hole in a window. There is no way to disable this feature.

				Vehicles are a large part of the game. The thief uses them as transportation and storage, and has the opportunity to steal several for profit.Two cars are available for the thief to use as transportation: A small hatchback, and a large van. Both cars have a white box in the passenger's seat that can be used to store additional loot.The trunk of the car, and back of the van, can also be used to carry larger items that don't fit in the thief's backpack.The thief's initial car is a black hatchback with two seats and a small amount of trunk space. It is waiting for him at the nearest curb after his first robbery. A white box sits on the floor between the glove compartment and the passenger's seat, and can be used to store up to 15 lbs of additional loot. The trunk can only support two flat-laying items and one upright item.
