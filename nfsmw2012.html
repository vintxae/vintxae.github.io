 			<p class="shape">

 				</h2>
 			</div>
 			<p class="shape">
 				The game takes place within the city of Fairhaven and features an upgraded Autolog 2.0 leaderboard system. Players will be able to compete against each other in both single player and multiplayer playlist events.Criterion Games' re-imagining of Need for Speed: Most Wanted focuses on gameplay and the player's progression to become the Most Wanted on their Speedwall, although the Blacklist (renamed to "Most Wanted List") returns with ten rivals. This is a big contrast to the 2005 Most Wanted title, which featured a story.

				Unlike Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit (2010), it is no longer possible to play as the police. Drifting plays a less dominant role than before.Players are awarded Speed Points (SP) upon completing events, performing stunts and beating a friend's Autolog record. Players will need to continue earning Speed Points in order to become the Most Wanted racer. Vehicles are also upgradable with performance modifications.

				The city features a plethora of Speed Cameras, Security Gates, and Billboards, which reward players with Speed Points. Billboards feature logos of EA's subsidiaries such as Visceral Games, DICE and BioWare. Smashed Billboards portray a wanted poster with a mugshot of the player that set the largest Jump Distance record through that billboard.The city features a series of Repair Shops that the player can pass through to repair their vehicle, change paint colour and refill Nitrous all at once.Players are able to earn vehicles by finding Jack Spots scattered throughout the city.
