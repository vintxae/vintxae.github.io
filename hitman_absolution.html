 				In Hitman: Absolution, the player assumes the role of Agent 47. Presented from a third-person perspective, the gameplay centers around completing set objectives within a series of levels. Objectives can range from simply reaching the end of the level, to killing specific individuals.Unlike its predecessors, Absolution follows linear gameplay. Big, sandbox type missions of previous titles are now replaced by linear levels, divided into several mini-missions, called segments, which are connected to each other via a single entrance or exit.

 			</p>
 			<p class="shape">
				Despite linear level design, however, players can choose how to complete each level to some extent, using firearms and melee weapons against enemies if opting for the action-oriented approach, or avoid enemies altogether and only attacking the set target(s), if using the stealth-oriented approach. Agent 47 also has the 'Instinct' ability that lets the player monitor enemies more easily. There are also environmental ways to kill or distract individuals; players can use poison to spike coffee, pull switches to make a disco ball fall and break, cause a massive explosion at a gas station, pull a switch to cause scaffolding to fall down, cause fires, or set off fireworks. Players complete chapters in order to progress through the story. The player journeys to various locations, including a mansion, library, strip club, gun store, wrestling arena, courthouse, and hotel during the story.

				Like the previous Hitman titles, Absolution also relies on disguise system to complete a mission. However the disguise detection system has been changed completely from previous games, as the people wearing similar clothes to that of 47 can see through his disguise faster, even from a medium distance, while others cannot see though it. Players can use instinct ability to blend into environment and act casually, thus eradicating the chances of detection through disguises.The game also introduces an online option to Hitman series, 'Contracts Mode', where players can create their own missions for other players to complete. Players choose one of the areas from the game's story missions and decide which NPC's are required to be eliminated, what weapon must be used to eliminate each target, what disguise is required, whether the body must be hidden or not and if the player is allowed to be spotted by the enemies. However servers for Contracts Mode has have since been shutdown, potentially forever.
