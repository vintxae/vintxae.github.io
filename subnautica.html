 					About Subnautica's Gameplay
 				</h2>
 			</div>
 			<p class="shape">
 				Subnautica is a survival, adventure game set in an open world environment and played from a first-person perspective. The player controls the lone survivor of a waylaid spacecraft called the Aurora, now stranded on a remote ocean planet named simply “4546B.” The main objective of the player is to explore the ocean and survive its dangers, while at the same time completing tasks that function to advance the plot. “Subnautica” allows the player to collect resources, construct tools, bases, and submersibles, and interact with the planet's wildlife.

				“Subnautica” takes place in the late 22nd century, when humanity begins to colonize other star systems. The Aurora, a deep-space vessel constructed by the trans-gov Alterra, has been sent to a system at the outer reaches of known space on its maiden voyage. Its goals are to build a section of high-speed space travel infrastructure known as a Phasegate in the Adrian wing of the galaxy, and to search for a lost ship, called the Degasi, which crashed on planet 4546B ten years prior. After the Aurora enters orbit of 4546B, it is physically waylaid by a mysterious force and crash-lands on the planet. Several crew members climb into lifepods and jettison from the Aurora during the descent, one of whom is the player character. The other lifepods' inhabitants perish through various means, leaving the player as the lone survivor. The player finds records of the Degasi's crew stating that two are confirmed dead and one is presumed dead. The player also learns of the existence of the "Precursors,” an alien species that came to planet 4546B long ago to research the "Kharaa Bacterium.” The Precursors officially quarantined 4546B when the bacterium escaped in a research accident. They brought a sea dragon leviathan egg to study, but the mother attacked the primary containment base, which released the bacterium.

				The planet's automated Quarantine Enforcement Platform shoots down ships that attempt to land or leave, in order to stop the bacterium from spreading to other worlds. The Aurora crashed because it appeared to be landing on the planet. The player witnesses another ship, the Sunbeam, get shot down after it had detected the Aurora's distress signal and traveled to the planet. When the player attempts to deactivate the installation, it fails due to the player being "infected.” In order to leave the planet, the player must locate the Precursors' base deep underground to find a Leviathan known as the Sea Emperor. It has been keeping the life in the area alive by using small creatures known as "Peepers" to distribute small amounts of a degraded form of the cure, “Enzyme 42,” which is produced by the Sea Emperor itself. This keeps the planet's flora and fauna alive but it is insufficient to eradicate the plague. The Sea Emperor asks the player to help it hatch its eggs because its young produce the cure in a purer form. Once the player hatches the eggs using a hatching enzyme crafted from various flora, the player is cured of the infection. The young then leave the base, curing the rest of the planet. The player is then free to disable the Quarantine Enforcement Platform, construct a Neptune escape rocket, and leave the planet, ending the game.
